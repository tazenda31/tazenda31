Hi! Welcome to my site.

My name is Maja. I'm a bookworm and wordworm since the age of three. I'm a linguist, always after patterns in language structure and texts. I research and/or teach psycholinguistics, cognitive linguistics and neural networks at the Department of German language and literature at the University of Zagreb, Croatia. (And some phonetics, too.)

I'm happy when I teach people who want to learn.
