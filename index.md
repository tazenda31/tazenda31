Hi! Welcome to my site.

My name is Maja. I'm a bookworm and wordworm since the age of three. A linguist, always after patterns in language structure and texts. I research and teach psycholinguistics, cognitive linguistics and research neural networks at the Department of German language and literature at the University of Zagreb, Croatia. (And some phonetics and other corners of languages and linguistics, too.)

At my happiest when learning something new.
Plivam, sviram, meditiram.
